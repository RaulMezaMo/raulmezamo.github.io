### Process

Brief -> Research & Strategy -> Imagination -> Design proposal

## Brief

Firstly, a brief is made with the most important information about the business, product, and the client to begin the design process: the objectives, expected results, final products, keywords, etc., this minimizes misunderstandings and speeds up the design process!

#### Who?

Medium sized, food related (maple syrup) company.
#### What?

Brand Identity, packaging and website for online presence
#### Why?

Increase memorability and become the #1 maple syrup product in the country.
#### When?

A month for the design process.
#### Where?

Digital, online presence.

## Research and Strategy
Based on the brief, research is done independently, accumulating information about the business, consumers, the market, and competitors. Deciding and communicating to the client the **key aspects** of the branding.

Brand values
Consumer persona.
Moodboard for the initial global concept.

## Imagination

First sketches.
Second batch of sketches.
Brainstorming with mind mapping.

Using the research and the brand values, keywords are generated, divided in nouns, adjectives, and colors; then correlated with shapes, colors, moods, etc., that can themselves be communicated graphically. 

I decided to go with the heart + the iconic maple leaf to take advantage of the memorability of both icons to the target audience, that way, the whole family can see the brand and recognize the icons, relating them with positive and warm feelings due to their familiarity.

Here it’s decided what the final colors, logos, and typography is going to be used for the logo as well as the manual, website, possible publicity, etc.

Color proposal.
Typography proposal.

By the end, I decided a 3d mockup would communicate best what the product is and show it in an abstract environment would emphasize it; alongside a website mockup and various graphics to show how ads and products may look like so we get a clear view of the final branding!
