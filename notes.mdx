# Notes

## Typography

I fixed the font "VG5000", using it in headers the em size was too big and causing the letters to overflow upwards and align to the top. I went into fontforge and in the Element->Font Info->OS/2->Metrics made sure the Win Ascent and Win Descent were 839 and 205 respectively so they added up to 1024 in the general tab, in the Em Size setting, as well as the Ascent and Descent in the same menu.

## Unused code

### Query for project-images-thumbnails
query MyQuery {
  allFile(filter: {relativeDirectory: {eq: "project-images"}}) {
    nodes {
      name
      relativeDirectory
    }
  }
}

### Query for images in corazon de maple
query MyQuery {
  allFile(filter: {relativeDirectory: {eq: "project-images/corazon-de-maple"}}) {
    nodes {
      name
      relativeDirectory
    }
  }
}


### Query mdx files for "Projects"
In return element:

 <div className="projectsGallery">
          <ul>
            {data.allFile.nodes.map(node => {
              return <li key={node.id}>{node.name}</li>
            })}
          </ul>
        </div>

In query:

export const query = graphql`
  query {
    allFile(filter: {sourceInstanceName: {eq: "projects"}, extension: {eq: "mdx"}}) {
      nodes {
        name
        id
      }
    }
    site {
        siteMetadata {
          title
        }
      }
  }
`;

# Troubles

Wanted to use .gif files, but couldn't get it to work within the mdx files, so I decided to convert them to .webp. After researching I came upon the google dev tool gif2webp, had trouble using it from wsl, but added the environment variable from the compiled executables in C:/tools/, so all I had to do was executing in the zsh terminal "gif2webp.exe" [file] -o [file-output-name].
