# Notes

## Typography

I fixed the font "VG5000", using it in headers the em size was too big and causing the letters to overflow upwards and align to the top. I went into fontforge and in the Element->Font Info->OS/2->Metrics made sure the Win Ascent and Win Descent were 839 and 205 respectively so they added up to 1024 in the general tab, in the Em Size setting, as well as the Ascent and Descent in the same menu.
